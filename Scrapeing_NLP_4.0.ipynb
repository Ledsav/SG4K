Playing doesn’t require supervision, although parents can enjoy playing along with their children and maybe even freshen up their own math skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nDragonBox Algebra 12+ introduces all these elements in a playful and colorful world appealing to all ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe player learns at his/her own pace by experimenting with rules that are introduced gradually. Progress is illustrated with the birth and growth of a dragon for each new chapter. \\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Patrick Marchal, Ph.D. in cognitive science, and Jean-Baptiste Huynh, a high school teacher, created DragonBox Algebra 12+ as an intuitive, interative and efficient way to learn algebra. \\r\\n\\r\\nDragonBox Algebra 12+ is based on a novel pedagogical method developed in Norway that focuses on discovery and experimentation.

You cannot simply let your kid play this app thinking you'll have any time to do anything you need to. The insistent app voice repeatedly asking the child to ”ask an adult to connect to the internet” is enough to turn the tablet into a frisbee.\",\n",
