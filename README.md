# SG4K
Project for the development of a serious game.

A serious game or applied game is a game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment. The “serious” adjective is generally prepended to refer to video games used by industries like defense, education, scientific exploration, health care, emergency management, city planning, engineering, and politics. The goal of my project group is to generate a tool for SG classification and NLP analysis from the play store and the development of a well-structured serious game to boost kids’ education after Covid-19.
