ABC Kids - Tracing & Phonics,"Looking for a fun, free, and simple educational app to help your toddler learn phonics and trace letters of the alphabet? Look no further than ABC Kids.

ABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!

ABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.

Best of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.

Features:
- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.
- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.
- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.
- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.
- No third party ads, no in-app purchases, no tricks. Just pure educational fun!

Note to Parents:
When creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it!

Kids Learn to Read Lite,"Reading made easy!

Already enjoyed by over five million families, Learn to Read with Tommy Turtle is a delightful game that invites preschool-aged children to blend sounds into words, read and form simple words, identify spoken words and learn word families.

Its six sections include:

★ <b>Magic Letter Bridge</b>: kids learn to blend letter sounds into words by moving Tommy the Turtle across the letter bridge

★ <b>Skateboards and Helmet</b>: children practice reading as they are asked to fit Tommy's animal friends with skateboards and helmets
.
★ <b>Turn the Blocks</b>: kids make words in a way that's fun by turning real-looking blocks with letters on each side until the word is spelled out.

★ <b>Word Ball</b>: children learn to identify spoken words by helping Tommy bat the right ball (only available in full version)

★ <b>Word Magic</b>: kids learn about word families as they fill the corresponding pot with potion and watch magic happen (only available in full version)

★ <b>Rocket Words</b>: children get to practice word families as they assemble and launch a rocket into space (only available in full version)

If your children do not know the alphabet sounds yet, we recommend our  Learn Letter Sounds with Carnival Kids app. And if your kids need to learn or practice the names of the letters, try our Learn ABC Letters with Captain Cat app.

Every section is designed to let children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable teacher, so they want to keep learning. Once your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time - and learning.","Reading made easy!<br><br>Already enjoyed by over five million families, Learn to Read with Tommy Turtle is a delightful game that invites preschool-aged children to blend sounds into words, read and form simple words, identify spoken words and learn word families.<br><br>Its six sections include:<br><br>★ <b>Magic Letter Bridge</b>: kids learn to blend letter sounds into words by moving Tommy the Turtle across the letter bridge<br><br>★ <b>Skateboards and Helmet</b>: children practice reading as they are asked to fit Tommy&#39;s animal friends with skateboards and helmets<br>.<br>★ <b>Turn the Blocks</b>: kids make words in a way that&#39;s fun by turning real-looking blocks with letters on each side until the word is spelled out.<br><br>★ <b>Word Ball</b>: children learn to identify spoken words by helping Tommy bat the right ball (only available in full version)<br><br>★ <b>Word Magic</b>: kids learn about word families as they fill the corresponding pot with potion and watch magic happen (only available in full version)<br><br>★ <b>Rocket Words</b>: children get to practice word families as they assemble and launch a rocket into space (only available in full version)<br><br>If your children do not know the alphabet sounds yet, we recommend our  Learn Letter Sounds with Carnival Kids app. And if your kids need to learn or practice the names of the letters, try our Learn ABC Letters with Captain Cat app.<br><br>Every section is designed to let children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable teacher, so they want to keep learning.

The perfect game for kids to learn to spell, while having fun! 🎉 The game helps young children learn to spell by sounding out words, phonics, and teaches how to associate letters with pictures. 🥰 Our goal with our collection of spelling games was to have the kids play and not realize they’ve learned to spell! ✏️

🌟 Game Modes:
✔️ Spelling: A picture is shown on the screen with letters outlined just above it. Children match the letters at the top by choosing from the tiles below, placing them in the correct order to spell out words. Kids get to learn to spell while learning phonics in the process.

✔️ Fill In Blank: Kids can spell out the name of the picture using letters on the screen. There’s just one catch, though: all the letters are jumbled up!

✔️ Blank Spelling: Letters are placed at the bottom of the screen, but this time there’s no clue at the top!

✔️ CVC: Consonant vowel consonant mode includes 5 additional free learning modes for kids to practice and to learn cvs’s. 

We truly believe phonics helps build a framework for spelling. We’ve included multiple phonics focused game modes. 🔥 Our goal from the beginning is to not simply get the child to remember the spelling, but to fully learn phonics in the process as well. ⌛

ABC Spelling was designed with both adults and children in mind. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  Kids will love the bright graphics, the easy to touch icons, and the fun cartoon drawings. 📝 Parents will love the report card feature that helps track learning progress. 🎯

👉 Best of all, ABC Spelling - Spell & Phonics is absolutely free, with no third party ads, paywalls, or other distractions. 🔥

Features:
✨ Fun, educational activities for toddlers, kids, and parents alike!
🎨 Colorful graphics and animations to help kids learn.
🎵 Sounds to help children learn phonics for letters and words.
📝 Report cards show learning progress.

In this application they learn addition, subtraction, multiplication and division at different levels.
Each operation contains four levels of learning:
In the first one, children learn visually by adding and subtracting fruits and multiplication and division tables have been added.
